# Caveman's Dragon Iron — Lore

This folder holds the lore and world-building for the **Dragon Iron** mod. Use it to keep the mod’s story consistent across tooltips, future books, advancements, and content.

## Contents

- **[Complete Lore](complete_lore.md)** — All lore combined in one document (vanilla End, overview, Ender Dragon's fire, Dragon Smiths & Endermen).
- **[Dragon Iron — Overview](dragon_iron_overview.md)** — What Dragon Iron is, where it comes from, and why it matters.
- **[The Ender Dragon's Fire](ender_dragon_fire.md)** — The flame that forges Dragon Iron and powers the furnace.
- **[Dragon Smiths & Endermen](dragon_smiths_and_endermen.md)** — The Dragon Smiths were adventurers who ventured into the End, found the metal (Dragon Iron), and could only forge it after finding the Dragon Iron forge in an End city.
- **[Vanilla End Lore](vanilla_end_lore.md)** — Pulled-down Minecraft lore for the End, the Ender Dragon, Endermen, and End cities so we can build on it consistently.

*Lore is written to match in-game tooltips: items forged in the fire of the Ender Dragon, fireproof gear, extremely durable and wither-resistant blocks, and the Dragon Iron Furnace fed by that same flame. Dragon Smiths are former adventurers who discovered Dragon Iron and the End city forge.*
