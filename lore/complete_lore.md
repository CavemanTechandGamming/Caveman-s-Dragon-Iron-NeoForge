# 1. Vanilla Minecraft: The End, the Ender Dragon, and Endermen

This section summarizes **official Minecraft lore and in-game facts** about the End dimension, the Ender Dragon, and Endermen. The Dragon Iron mod builds on this foundation so that our lore stays consistent with vanilla.

## The End

- The **End** is a dark, void-like dimension made of floating **islands** of **End stone** in the void.
- It is reached by activating an **End portal** in a **stronghold** (using Eyes of Ender).
- The dimension has a **central island** where the player first arrives. After the Ender Dragon is defeated, **End gateway** portals appear and allow travel to the **outer islands**, which lie roughly 1000 blocks away across the void.
- The End is inhabited by **Endermen** (everywhere) and **Shulkers** (in End cities). The **Ender Dragon** spawns on the central island when a player first enters.
- There is no day/night cycle; the "sky" is starless and dim, with a faint purple tint. Beds and respawn anchors explode if used there.
- **End cities** are skyscraper-like structures found on the **outer islands**. They are built from purpur blocks, end stone bricks, and other materials, and are inhabited by Shulkers. **End ships** sometimes generate attached to End cities and hold unique loot (elytra, dragon head). End cities are the only place these structures appear—ancient, unexplained, and tied to the End.

Vanilla does not state who built the End cities or why. Our mod's lore assumes they are old and that something as rare as a **Dragon Iron forge** could have existed there.

## The Ender Dragon (vanilla)

- The **Ender Dragon** is a giant flying **boss** and the largest naturally spawning mob. It appears when a player first enters the End.
- It has **purple eyes** (like Endermen) and black/grey coloring. It **attacks with fireballs** and a **breath attack** that creates damaging effect clouds. It can charge and strike with its body; it is hostile to players on sight.
- The dragon **flies around the central island** and is **healed by End crystals** on top of obsidian pillars. Destroying a crystal while it is healing damages the dragon.
- It is **immune to fire**, drowning, freezing, poison, lightning, and the void. It can pass through most blocks and destroy them (except End stone, obsidian, bedrock, and a few others).
- When defeated, it ascends, disintegrates in beams of light, and **drops a large amount of XP**. The **exit portal** activates so the player can return to the Overworld; a **dragon egg** appears above the portal; and **End gateway** portals generate so the player can reach the outer islands.
- The dragon can be **re-summoned** by placing four End crystals on the edges of the exit portal. Defeating it again opens another gateway (up to 20) but does not produce another dragon egg (in Java).
- Vanilla gives **no detailed backstory** for why the dragon exists or its exact link to the End. It is the "final boss" and guardian of that dimension. For our mod we treat its **fire** as the source of Dragon Iron—the flame that forges and empowers the metal.

## Endermen (vanilla)

- **Endermen** are tall, neutral mobs found in **all three dimensions** (Overworld, Nether, End). They are the only mob that spawns naturally in all three.
- They have **purple eyes** and a dark, slender build. They become **hostile** if a player looks directly at their face or attacks them.
- They **teleport** frequently—to escape danger (water, rain, projectiles, etc.) or at random. They can **pick up and move** certain blocks (e.g. grass, dirt, flowers).
- When killed they drop **Ender Pearls** (used for Eyes of Ender and teleportation). In the **End** they spawn commonly in groups of four; in the Overworld and Nether they spawn in darker areas.
- Vanilla does not explain their origin or why they carry Ender Pearls. Their name and behavior tie them clearly to **the End**. Many players and lore interpretations treat them as natives or servants of that dimension, or as beings that move between worlds.

For the Dragon Iron mod we add: **Endermen sometimes drop Dragon Iron nuggets.** That makes them the bridge between the Ender Dragon's realm and the Overworld—the only way Dragon Iron reaches the world of the living. Our lore can say they carry traces of the End, or of the dragon's domain, and that those traces sometimes take the form of nuggets.

## End Cities (vanilla, for Dragon Iron lore)

- **End cities** appear only on the **outer islands**, reachable after defeating the dragon and using an End gateway.
- They are tall, tower-like structures of **purpur**, **end stone bricks**, **end rods**, stained glass, chests, and other blocks. They contain **Shulkers** and valuable loot (including enchanted gear, elytra on ships, dragon head).
- Vanilla does not say who built them or when. They feel **ancient and abandoned**, with no builders left—only Shulkers and loot.

For our mod we say: somewhere in these cities, the first **Dragon Iron forge** (the furnace that runs on the Ender Dragon's flame) was found. The adventurers who would become **Dragon Smiths** could only learn to work Dragon Iron after discovering that forge. So End cities are not only a source of elytra and treasure—they are where the secret of forging Dragon Iron was recovered.

# 2. Dragon Iron — Overview

## What Is Dragon Iron?

**Dragon Iron** is a metal that exists only because of the **Ender Dragon**. It is not mined from the earth. It is not found in veins or ruins. It is **forged in the fire of the Ender Dragon**—a flame that does not simply melt ore, but transforms it. Whatever is tempered in that fire becomes fireproof, and whatever is wrought from it becomes nearly impossible to wear away. Even the harshest touch—the kind that would rot or wither lesser materials—cannot claim it.

So Dragon Iron is more than a metal. It is a **remnant of the dragon's breath**: rare, powerful, and bound to the End.

## How It Enters the World

Dragon Iron does not appear in the Overworld by chance. The **Endermen** carry it.

No one fully agrees on why. Some say the Endermen were once closer to the dragon, and that they still carry traces of its realm—nuggets that formed in the End or that fell from the dragon's presence. However it began, **Endermen sometimes drop Dragon Iron nuggets** when they die. Those nuggets are the only way Dragon Iron reaches the world of the living. From there, smiths smelt nuggets into ingots, ingots into blocks, and blocks into everything from blades and armor to glass, doors, and the legendary **Dragon Iron Furnace**.

So the line is clear: **Ender Dragon → Endermen → nuggets → everything else.**

## What Can Be Made

- **Items (tools, weapons, armor, ingots, nuggets)** — All forged in the Ender Dragon's fire. All **fireproof**. They are the gear of those who dare to work with dragon-touched metal.
- **Blocks (building and decoration)** — Walls, doors, fences, glass, stairs, slabs, trapdoors, pressure plates, buttons, and the fancy Dragon Iron block. All **extremely durable**. They do not rust, rot, or give way to the same forces that destroy ordinary materials—a subtle hint that they withstand what would wither others.
- **The Dragon Iron Furnace** — The crown of the set. Forged in the Ender Dragon's fire and **fed by that same flame**. It smelts at **twice the speed** of a normal furnace, as if the dragon's breath still burns inside it.

## The Dragon Smith

Those who specialize in Dragon Iron are called **Dragon Smiths**. They were **adventurers once**—they ventured into the End, found a metal that was crazy durable and strong, and named it **Dragon Iron**. They could not forge it with any ordinary furnace or anvil. Only when they found the **Dragon Iron forge in an End city** (on the outer islands, after defeating the dragon) did they learn to smelt and work it. That discovery turned them from adventurers into smiths. Today they trade in nuggets, ingots, blocks, and finished goods—from shovels and swords to full armor and the furnace itself. The Dragon Iron Furnace used in the Overworld is a recreation of that ancient End city forge, fed by the same dragon flame.

# 3. The Ender Dragon's Fire

## The Flame That Forges

The **Ender Dragon** is not only a guardian of the End. In the lore of Dragon Iron, the dragon is the **source of the flame** that makes the metal what it is. Ordinary fire can melt ore. The dragon's fire **transforms** it. What is forged in that flame does not simply cool into metal—it becomes **Dragon Iron**: fireproof, enduring, and touched by the End.

So when tooltips say that something is *"forged in the fire of the Ender Dragon,"* they mean it literally. The material was made in that flame, and that flame is what gives it its properties.

## Fireproof

Anything that is an **item** made of Dragon Iron—ingots, nuggets, tools, weapons, armor—is **fireproof**. It can sit in lava or in a blaze's path and not burn. In lore terms: the dragon's fire is already in the metal. No lesser flame can claim it.

## Extremely Durable (and a Hint at More)

**Blocks** of Dragon Iron are described as **extremely durable**, and that *"even the harshest touch cannot wear it away."* That wording is deliberate. In the world of the game, there are forces that wear down or destroy blocks—including the kind of decay and corruption that would "touch" a block in a withering way. Dragon Iron is written so that it **resists that** without the lore having to name the mechanic outright. So: extremely durable, and implied to withstand what would rot or wither other things.

## The Furnace: Fed by the Same Flame

The **Dragon Iron Furnace** is special. It is not only *forged* in the Ender Dragon's fire—it is **powered** by it. The first such forge was **found in an End city** by the adventurers who would become Dragon Smiths; they could not work Dragon Iron until they discovered it. The furnaces used in the Overworld are recreations of that ancient End city forge. The lore says the furnace is *"fed by that same flame"* and that *"the heart of the dragon still burns within."* So when it smelts at **twice the speed** of a normal furnace, it is because the dragon's fire is still at work inside it. That's the in-world explanation for the 2× smelt speed: the flame of the Ender Dragon never really went out in that furnace.

# 4. Dragon Smiths & Endermen

## The Dragon Smiths Were Adventurers First

The **Dragon Smiths** did not start as smiths. They started as **adventurers**.

They ventured into **the End**—through the stronghold portal, past the void, and into that dark dimension where the Ender Dragon rules and Endermen walk. They went for glory, for treasure, or for the same reason anyone crosses into the unknown: because it was there. What they found changed them.

## What They Found in the End

In the End they found a **metal**. It was like nothing in the Overworld. It did not rust. It did not melt in ordinary fire. It was **crazy durable** and **strong**—the kind of material that could take the dragon's breath and come out unchanged. They had no name for it at first. They only knew that it was rare, that it seemed to belong to that place, and that the **Endermen** sometimes carried it.

When an Enderman fell, sometimes it left behind a **nugget** of that metal. So the adventurers began to call it **Dragon Iron**—because it came from the realm of the Ender Dragon, and because nothing else could explain its strength. They brought nuggets back to the Overworld. They tried to smelt them. They tried to forge them. **Nothing worked.** No ordinary furnace could turn Dragon Iron into ingots. No ordinary anvil could shape it. The metal refused to yield.

## The Forge in the End City

The secret lay in **the End cities**.

After the dragon was defeated, the adventurers passed through the **End gateway** to the outer islands. There they found the tall, ancient structures of purpur and end stone—**End cities**, full of Shulkers and loot. And in one of those cities they found something that should not have been there: a **forge**.

Not a normal forge. A furnace that still held a hint of **the Ender Dragon's flame**. A place where Dragon Iron could finally be **smelted and worked**. They had no idea who had built it or when. The city was empty of builders; only the structure remained. But the forge worked. In that furnace, nuggets became ingots. With that heat, Dragon Iron could be shaped into tools, armor, blocks, and glass.

**They could only forge Dragon Iron after they found that forge in the End city.** Until then, the metal was little more than a curiosity—strong, beautiful, and useless. The forge was the key. So the adventurers who had gone into the End as treasure-seekers became something else. They became **Dragon Smiths**: the ones who had seen the dragon's realm, who had found the metal and the flame that could work it, and who had brought that knowledge back.

## Bringing the Flame Back

The Dragon Iron Furnace that villagers and players use in the Overworld is not the original. It is a **recreation**—built in the image of the forge they found in the End city. Forged in the fire of the Ender Dragon (or at least in metal tempered by it), and **fed by that same flame** in spirit: the heart of the dragon still burns within, so it smelts twice as fast as any common furnace. The Dragon Smiths learned to build them. So the legacy of that first discovery—adventurers, End city, forge—lives on in every Dragon Iron Furnace in the world.

## Endermen: The Bridge

**Endermen** remain the only way Dragon Iron nuggets reach the Overworld. No one mines Dragon Iron. No one finds it in veins. It comes from the End, and it comes **through the Endermen**—who sometimes drop a nugget when they die. Why they carry it, no one can say for certain. Perhaps they are bound to the dragon's realm and bear traces of its fire. Perhaps the nuggets form where they walk. What matters is: **no Endermen, no nuggets; no nuggets, no Dragon Iron.** So Dragon Smiths and every player who works Dragon Iron depend on the same chain: Ender Dragon → Endermen (nuggets) → the forge (in the End city, or its recreated furnace in the Overworld) → ingots, blocks, tools, and armor.

The Dragon Smiths remember. They were adventurers once. They went into the End, found a metal that refused to break, named it Dragon Iron, and only learned to use it when they found the forge in an End city. Now they are the keepers of that craft—and of the story.
