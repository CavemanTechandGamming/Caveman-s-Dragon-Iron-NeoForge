# Dragon Iron — Overview (Canon-Aligned)

*This document aligns with the [Complete Lore (Canon-Aligned Edition)](complete_lore.md). Dragon Iron does not belong to the Overworld. It is a relic of the End, and of the flame that rules it.*

## What Is Dragon Iron?

Dragon Iron does not exist in veins. It cannot be mined.

It is not a natural resource of the Overworld.

Dragon Iron is created only through exposure to the fire of the Ender Dragon.

This flame does not simply melt matter. It transforms it.

Metal exposed to the dragon's breath becomes something else—something changed at its very nature. It becomes immune to ordinary fire, resistant to decay, and nearly impossible to destroy.

Dragon Iron is not merely metal.

**It is matter rewritten by the End itself.**

## How Dragon Iron Reaches the Overworld

No mortal can harvest Dragon Iron directly from the dragon.

Instead, Dragon Iron enters the Overworld through the Endermen.

These beings, already capable of traversing dimensions, sometimes carry fragments of Dragon Iron in the form of nuggets. Whether they gather it intentionally, absorb it through proximity, or simply carry residue from the dragon's domain remains unknown.

What is known is this:

**Without Endermen, Dragon Iron would never leave the End.**

They are the bridge between realms.

The chain of existence is absolute:

**Ender Dragon → Endermen → Dragon Iron Nuggets → Mortal Forging**

Only after the first adventurers found the forge in an abandoned End City could nuggets be smelted into ingots and ingots into tools, armor, blocks, and the Dragon Iron Furnace. (See [Dragon Smiths & Endermen](dragon_smiths_and_endermen.md).)

## What Can Be Made

- **Items** (tools, weapons, armor, ingots, nuggets) — All forged in dragonfire. All **fireproof**.
- **Blocks** (walls, doors, fences, glass, stairs, slabs, trapdoors, pressure plates, buttons, fancy block) — All **extremely durable**; they resist what would erode, corrode, or decay ordinary materials.
- **The Dragon Iron Furnace** — Built from Dragon Iron itself; it carries the properties of the original flame and smelts twice as quickly as ordinary furnaces. (See [The Ender Dragon's Fire](ender_dragon_fire.md).)

## Properties of Dragon Iron

Dragon Iron retains the defining traits of its origin:

**Fireproof** — Having been forged in dragonfire, it cannot be destroyed by lesser flames.

**Extremely Durable** — Dragon Iron resists forces that would erode, corrode, or decay ordinary materials.

**End-Bound** — It does not originate in the Overworld. Every fragment traces its existence to the End.

## The Dragon Smith

Those who specialize in Dragon Iron are the **Dragon Smiths**—inheritors of lost knowledge, keepers of forbidden craft. They alone understand how to work Dragon Iron; they trade in its nuggets, ingots, tools, armor, and furnaces. They remember what others forget: every ingot is a fragment of the End, every furnace is an echo of dragonfire, and every tool is proof that mortals learned to wield the power of something far older than themselves. (See [Dragon Smiths & Endermen](dragon_smiths_and_endermen.md).)
