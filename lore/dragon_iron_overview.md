# Dragon Iron — Overview

## What Is Dragon Iron?

**Dragon Iron** is a metal that exists only because of the **Ender Dragon**. It is not mined from the earth. It is not found in veins or ruins. It is **forged in the fire of the Ender Dragon**—a flame that does not simply melt ore, but transforms it. Whatever is tempered in that fire becomes fireproof, and whatever is wrought from it becomes nearly impossible to wear away. Even the harshest touch—the kind that would rot or wither lesser materials—cannot claim it.

So Dragon Iron is more than a metal. It is a **remnant of the dragon’s breath**: rare, powerful, and bound to the End.

## How It Enters the World

Dragon Iron does not appear in the Overworld by chance. The **Endermen** carry it.

No one fully agrees on why. Some say the Endermen were once closer to the dragon, and that they still carry traces of its realm—nuggets that formed in the End or that fell from the dragon’s presence. However it began, **Endermen sometimes drop Dragon Iron nuggets** when they die. Those nuggets are the only way Dragon Iron reaches the world of the living. From there, smiths smelt nuggets into ingots, ingots into blocks, and blocks into everything from blades and armor to glass, doors, and the legendary **Dragon Iron Furnace**.

So the line is clear: **Ender Dragon → Endermen → nuggets → everything else.**

## What Can Be Made

- **Items (tools, weapons, armor, ingots, nuggets)** — All forged in the Ender Dragon’s fire. All **fireproof**. They are the gear of those who dare to work with dragon-touched metal.
- **Blocks (building and decoration)** — Walls, doors, fences, glass, stairs, slabs, trapdoors, pressure plates, buttons, and the fancy Dragon Iron block. All **extremely durable**. They do not rust, rot, or give way to the same forces that destroy ordinary materials—a subtle hint that they withstand what would wither others.
- **The Dragon Iron Furnace** — The crown of the set. Forged in the Ender Dragon’s fire and **fed by that same flame**. It smelts at **twice the speed** of a normal furnace, as if the dragon’s breath still burns inside it.

## The Dragon Smith

Those who specialize in Dragon Iron are called **Dragon Smiths**. They trade in nuggets, ingots, blocks, and finished goods—from shovels and swords to full armor and the furnace itself. To them, Dragon Iron is not just a material. It is the legacy of the Ender Dragon’s fire, and they are the ones who keep that legacy alive in the Overworld.
