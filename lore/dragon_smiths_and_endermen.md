## How Dragon Iron Reaches the Overworld

No mortal can harvest Dragon Iron directly from the dragon.

Instead, Dragon Iron enters the Overworld through the Endermen.

These beings, already capable of traversing dimensions, sometimes carry fragments of Dragon Iron in the form of nuggets. Whether they gather it intentionally, absorb it through proximity, or simply carry residue from the dragon's domain remains unknown.

What is known is this:

**Without Endermen, Dragon Iron would never leave the End.**

They are the bridge between realms.

The chain of existence is absolute:

**Ender Dragon → Endermen → Dragon Iron Nuggets → Mortal Forging**

## The Discovery of the Forge

The first Dragon Smiths were not smiths at all.

They were adventurers.

They entered the End seeking treasure, glory, or answers. They encountered Endermen carrying fragments of an unknown metal—stronger than iron, immune to fire, and impossible to shape.

They brought these fragments home.

They failed.

No furnace could smelt it. No forge could shape it. No heat could change it.

The metal resisted the Overworld.

Only after the dragon fell did they discover the truth.

On the outer islands, within an abandoned End City, they found a forge unlike any other. It still held traces of the dragon's flame—a heat that did not fade with time.

Within that forge, Dragon Iron yielded.

Nuggets became ingots.

Ingots became tools.

Metal became legacy.

**The adventurers became Dragon Smiths.**

## The Dragon Iron Furnace — Legacy of the End

The original forge remained in the End.

But the Dragon Smiths learned.

Through Dragon Iron itself—already transformed by dragonfire—they constructed new furnaces in the Overworld. These furnaces carry within them the properties of the original flame. They smelt twice as quickly as ordinary furnaces—not through fuel alone, but through the lingering influence of dragonfire embedded within their structure.

Each Dragon Iron Furnace is not powered by the dragon directly, but by metal that has already been changed by it.

**The dragon's flame lives on through the material it created.**

## The Dragon Smiths — Keepers of Forbidden Craft

Dragon Smiths are the inheritors of lost knowledge.

They alone understand how to work Dragon Iron. They trade in its nuggets, ingots, tools, armor, and furnaces. They preserve the methods discovered in the End Cities.

They remember what others forget:

Dragon Iron is not a gift of the Overworld.

It is a relic of another realm.

Every ingot is a fragment of the End.

Every furnace is an echo of dragonfire.

Every tool is proof that mortals learned to wield the power of something far older than themselves.
