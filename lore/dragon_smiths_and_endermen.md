# Dragon Smiths & Endermen

## Where the Nuggets Come From

Dragon Iron does not grow in the ground. It enters the Overworld through **Endermen**. When an Enderman is killed, there is a chance it will drop a **Dragon Iron nugget**. That chance can be increased with the Looting enchantment, and the exact base chance is something the player can configure—but in lore, the point is fixed: **Endermen are the only source of raw Dragon Iron in the world.**

Why Endermen? The lore leaves room for interpretation. Perhaps they carry fragments of the End. Perhaps they were once bound to the Ender Dragon and still bear traces of its realm. Perhaps the nuggets form in the same place the Endermen go when they vanish. What matters for the mod is: **no Endermen, no nuggets; no nuggets, no Dragon Iron.** So Endermen are the bridge between the dragon’s realm and the Overworld’s smithies.

## From Nuggets to Everything

- **Nuggets** → smelted (or traded) into **ingots**
- **Ingots** → crafted into **blocks**, **tools**, **weapons**, **armor**, **glass**, **doors**, **furnaces**, and more
- **Blocks** → used for building and redstone

The **Dragon Smith** villager profession exists to support this. Dragon Smiths trade emeralds for nuggets, ingots, blocks, and finished gear. They represent the idea that Dragon Iron is rare and precious—something that not every village has, and that specialists are needed to work with it.

## The Dragon Smith

A **Dragon Smith** is a villager who has dedicated their craft to Dragon Iron. They know how to smelt nuggets, work ingots, and forge the furnace that runs on the Ender Dragon’s flame. In lore, they are the keepers of that tradition: the ones who turn what the Endermen carry into the tools and structures that define Dragon Iron in the Overworld.

When you trade with a Dragon Smith, you are not just buying items. You are buying pieces of a story that begins in the End and is sustained by the dragon’s fire.
