# The Ender Dragon's Fire

## The Flame That Forges

The **Ender Dragon** is not only a guardian of the End. In the lore of Dragon Iron, the dragon is the **source of the flame** that makes the metal what it is. Ordinary fire can melt ore. The dragon’s fire **transforms** it. What is forged in that flame does not simply cool into metal—it becomes **Dragon Iron**: fireproof, enduring, and touched by the End.

So when tooltips say that something is *“forged in the fire of the Ender Dragon,”* they mean it literally. The material was made in that flame, and that flame is what gives it its properties.

## Fireproof

Anything that is an **item** made of Dragon Iron—ingots, nuggets, tools, weapons, armor—is **fireproof**. It can sit in lava or in a blaze’s path and not burn. In lore terms: the dragon’s fire is already in the metal. No lesser flame can claim it.

## Extremely Durable (and a Hint at More)

**Blocks** of Dragon Iron are described as **extremely durable**, and that *“even the harshest touch cannot wear it away.”* That wording is deliberate. In the world of the game, there are forces that wear down or destroy blocks—including the kind of decay and corruption that would “touch” a block in a withering way. Dragon Iron is written so that it **resists that** without the lore having to name the mechanic outright. So: extremely durable, and implied to withstand what would rot or wither other things.

## The Furnace: Fed by the Same Flame

The **Dragon Iron Furnace** is special. It is not only *forged* in the Ender Dragon’s fire—it is **powered** by it. The first such forge was **found in an End city** by the adventurers who would become Dragon Smiths; they could not work Dragon Iron until they discovered it. The furnaces used in the Overworld are recreations of that ancient End city forge. The lore says the furnace is *“fed by that same flame”* and that *“the heart of the dragon still burns within.”* So when it smelts at **twice the speed** of a normal furnace, it is because the dragon’s fire is still at work inside it. That’s the in-world explanation for the 2× smelt speed: the flame of the Ender Dragon never really went out in that furnace.

*Keep this in mind for any future content: the Ender Dragon’s fire is the single source of Dragon Iron’s power. Items carry that as fireproofing; blocks carry it as durability and resistance to the harshest touch; the furnace carries it as both durability and the flame that drives its speed.*
