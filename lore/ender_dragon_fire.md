# The Ender Dragon's Fire (Canon-Aligned)

*This document aligns with the [Complete Lore (Canon-Aligned Edition)](complete_lore.md). The dragon's fire does not simply melt matter—it transforms it.*

## Metal Born of Dragonfire

Dragon Iron is created only through exposure to the fire of the Ender Dragon.

This flame does not simply melt matter. It transforms it.

Metal exposed to the dragon's breath becomes something else—something changed at its very nature. It becomes immune to ordinary fire, resistant to decay, and nearly impossible to destroy.

Dragon Iron is not merely metal.

**It is matter rewritten by the End itself.**

So when tooltips say that something is *"forged in the fire of the Ender Dragon,"* they mean it literally. The material was made in that flame, and that flame is what gives it its properties.

## Fireproof

Anything that is an **item** made of Dragon Iron—ingots, nuggets, tools, weapons, armor—is **fireproof**. Having been forged in dragonfire, it cannot be destroyed by lesser flames. The dragon's fire is already in the metal; no other flame can claim it.

## Extremely Durable (and a Hint at More)

**Blocks** of Dragon Iron are **extremely durable**. Dragon Iron resists forces that would erode, corrode, or decay ordinary materials. The wording *"even the harshest touch cannot wear it away"* implies that it withstands what would rot or wither other things—without the lore naming that force outright.

## The Dragon Iron Furnace — Legacy of the End

The original forge remained in the End.

But the Dragon Smiths learned.

Through Dragon Iron itself—already transformed by dragonfire—they constructed new furnaces in the Overworld. These furnaces carry within them the properties of the original flame.

They burn hotter.

They work faster.

They smelt twice as quickly as ordinary furnaces—not through fuel alone, but through the lingering influence of dragonfire embedded within their structure.

Each Dragon Iron Furnace is not powered by the dragon directly, but by metal that has already been changed by it.

**The dragon's flame lives on through the material it created.**

That is the in-world explanation for the 2× smelt speed: the flame never really went out; it persists through the metal it transformed.
