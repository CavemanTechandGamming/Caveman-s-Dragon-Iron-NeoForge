# Vanilla Minecraft: The End, the Ender Dragon, and Endermen

This document summarizes **official Minecraft lore and in-game facts** about the End dimension, the Ender Dragon, and Endermen. The Dragon Iron mod builds on this foundation so that our lore stays consistent with vanilla.

---

## The End

- The **End** is a dark, void-like dimension made of floating **islands** of **End stone** in the void.
- It is reached by activating an **End portal** in a **stronghold** (using Eyes of Ender).
- The dimension has a **central island** where the player first arrives. After the Ender Dragon is defeated, **End gateway** portals appear and allow travel to the **outer islands**, which lie roughly 1000 blocks away across the void.
- The End is inhabited by **Endermen** (everywhere) and **Shulkers** (in End cities). The **Ender Dragon** spawns on the central island when a player first enters.
- There is no day/night cycle; the “sky” is starless and dim, with a faint purple tint. Beds and respawn anchors explode if used there.
- **End cities** are skyscraper-like structures found on the **outer islands**. They are built from purpur blocks, end stone bricks, and other materials, and are inhabited by Shulkers. **End ships** sometimes generate attached to End cities and hold unique loot (elytra, dragon head). End cities are the only place these structures appear—ancient, unexplained, and tied to the End.

Vanilla does not state who built the End cities or why. Our mod’s lore assumes they are old and that something as rare as a **Dragon Iron forge** could have existed there.

## The Ender Dragon

- The **Ender Dragon** is a giant flying **boss** and the largest naturally spawning mob. It appears when a player first enters the End.
- It has **purple eyes** (like Endermen) and black/grey coloring. It **attacks with fireballs** and a **breath attack** that creates damaging effect clouds. It can charge and strike with its body; it is hostile to players on sight.
- The dragon **flies around the central island** and is **healed by End crystals** on top of obsidian pillars. Destroying a crystal while it is healing damages the dragon.
- It is **immune to fire**, drowning, freezing, poison, lightning, and the void. It can pass through most blocks and destroy them (except End stone, obsidian, bedrock, and a few others).
- When defeated, it ascends, disintegrates in beams of light, and **drops a large amount of XP**. The **exit portal** activates so the player can return to the Overworld; a **dragon egg** appears above the portal; and **End gateway** portals generate so the player can reach the outer islands.
- The dragon can be **re-summoned** by placing four End crystals on the edges of the exit portal. Defeating it again opens another gateway (up to 20) but does not produce another dragon egg (in Java).
- Vanilla gives **no detailed backstory** for why the dragon exists or its exact link to the End. It is the “final boss” and guardian of that dimension. For our mod we treat its **fire** as the source of Dragon Iron—the flame that forges and empowers the metal.

## Endermen

- **Endermen** are tall, neutral mobs found in **all three dimensions** (Overworld, Nether, End). They are the only mob that spawns naturally in all three.
- They have **purple eyes** and a dark, slender build. They become **hostile** if a player looks directly at their face or attacks them.
- They **teleport** frequently—to escape danger (water, rain, projectiles, etc.) or at random. They can **pick up and move** certain blocks (e.g. grass, dirt, flowers).
- When killed they drop **Ender Pearls** (used for Eyes of Ender and teleportation). In the **End** they spawn commonly in groups of four; in the Overworld and Nether they spawn in darker areas.
- Vanilla does not explain their origin or why they carry Ender Pearls. Their name and behavior tie them clearly to **the End**. Many players and lore interpretations treat them as natives or servants of that dimension, or as beings that move between worlds.

For the Dragon Iron mod we add: **Endermen sometimes drop Dragon Iron nuggets.** That makes them the bridge between the Ender Dragon’s realm and the Overworld—the only way Dragon Iron reaches the world of the living. Our lore can say they carry traces of the End, or of the dragon’s domain, and that those traces sometimes take the form of nuggets.

## End Cities (for Dragon Iron lore)

- **End cities** appear only on the **outer islands**, reachable after defeating the dragon and using an End gateway.
- They are tall, tower-like structures of **purpur**, **end stone bricks**, **end rods**, stained glass, chests, and other blocks. They contain **Shulkers** and valuable loot (including enchanted gear, elytra on ships, dragon head).
- Vanilla does not say who built them or when. They feel **ancient and abandoned**, with no builders left—only Shulkers and loot.

For our mod we say: somewhere in these cities, the first **Dragon Iron forge** (the furnace that runs on the Ender Dragon’s flame) was found. The adventurers who would become **Dragon Smiths** could only learn to work Dragon Iron after discovering that forge. So End cities are not only a source of elytra and treasure—they are where the secret of forging Dragon Iron was recovered.
