## I. The End — The Final Horizon

Beyond the Overworld and beneath the Nether lies a third realm: the End.

It is not a world in the traditional sense, but a silent expanse suspended over a bottomless void. Its islands, formed from pale End stone, drift in eternal stillness beneath a dim, violet sky devoid of sun, moon, or stars. Time does not pass there as it does elsewhere. There is no dawn. No dusk. Only unbroken twilight.

The End is reached through ancient strongholds buried deep beneath the Overworld—ruins of a civilization long vanished. At their heart rests the End Portal, a dormant frame of alien stone that can only be awakened through the power of Eyes of Ender. When activated, the portal opens not a gateway between places, but between realities.

Travelers who enter arrive upon the central island, where obsidian pillars rise like monuments around a silent arena. There, the End reveals its sovereign.

## II. The Ender Dragon — Sovereign of the Void

The Ender Dragon is the undisputed ruler of the End.

It is the largest naturally occurring creature known to exist: a being of immense size, dark scales, and burning violet eyes that mirror those of the Endermen. It does not hunt for sustenance, nor does it roam beyond its domain. It guards.

Obsidian pillars crowned with End crystals restore its strength, binding it to the island through ancient mechanisms whose creators remain unknown. When threatened, it retaliates with overwhelming force—charging through stone, unleashing volatile breath, and reshaping the battlefield itself.

When the dragon falls, it does not die as mortal creatures do. Its body disintegrates into light and energy, leaving behind no corpse—only experience, a single dragon egg, and newly opened gateways to the outer reaches of the End.

The dragon can be summoned again through ritual, suggesting its existence is not bound to simple life or death, but to the End itself.

Vanilla records do not explain the dragon's origin. It is not described as invader or native, weapon or guardian. It simply is.

For those who would later discover Dragon Iron, one truth became clear:

**The dragon's fire was unlike any other flame in existence.**

## III. The Endermen — Walkers Between Worlds

Endermen are among the most enigmatic beings known.

Tall, slender, and silent, they exist in all three dimensions: the Overworld, the Nether, and the End. No other creature naturally shares this trait. Their glowing violet eyes mark their connection to the End, regardless of where they appear.

They do not behave as predators by nature. Instead, they observe. They move. They carry.

Endermen possess the ability to teleport across space instantly, vanishing and reappearing without warning. They gather and transport blocks for reasons unknown, rearranging the world in small, deliberate ways.

When slain, they leave behind Ender Pearls—objects containing fragments of spatial distortion itself. These pearls allow mortals to bend space in imitation of the Endermen's natural ability.

Vanilla lore does not explain why Endermen exist in multiple dimensions, nor why they carry these artifacts. Their purpose remains unwritten.

But one fact would change everything:

**On rare occasions, Endermen carried more than pearls.**

**They carried fragments of Dragon Iron.**

## IV. The Outer Islands and the Lost Cities

Beyond the central island lie the outer islands, accessible only after the Ender Dragon has fallen and the gateway portals have opened.

There stand the End Cities.

They rise from the End stone like fossilized spires—vast structures of purpur, end stone brick, and glass. Their halls contain advanced architectural designs, suspended platforms, and End ships bearing treasures not found anywhere else, including elytra and dragon heads.

No builders remain.

Only Shulkers linger, silently guarding these abandoned places.

Vanilla history provides no explanation for who constructed the End Cities, when they were built, or why they were abandoned. They stand as relics of a vanished civilization—proof that something once lived, built, and mastered the End.

And within those silent cities, another secret remained hidden.

**A forge.**
