# Caveman's Dragon Iron

I built this mod because I wanted a *real* endgame tier—something that feels like it belongs in Minecraft, not bolted on. **Dragon Iron** is forged from the End: you hunt Endermen for nuggets, smelt them into ingots, and unlock a full ecosystem of tools, armor, and blocks that sit cleanly above Netherite. No gimmicks, no feature bloat—just a material that rewards the late game with power and style, and a world that explains itself through six in-game lore books and a villager who actually has a place in the progression.

If you care about balance, vanilla feel, and mods that read like they were designed, not generated—this one's for you.

## What's in the mod

**The material.** Dragon Iron nuggets drop from Endermen (rate is configurable; Looting adds 10% per level). You can also find remnants in End City treasure—nuggets, ingots, even the odd furnace or piece of enchanted gear, so exploration pays off. Smelt nuggets into ingots and you're in business.

**Tools & combat.** Full tool set—sword, pickaxe, axe, shovel, hoe—plus a **Dragon Iron Hammer** that mines in a 3×3 area. Stats sit above Netherite: higher durability, speed, and damage. Everything is fire-resistant because it's *Dragon* Iron.

**Armor.** Full set, same tier. Wear it all and you get Water Breathing, Fire Resistance, and Saturation while equipped—built for the kind of endgame where you stop worrying about preparation and start *living* in the harsh stuff.

**Building.** Full block set: blocks, stairs, slabs, walls, fences, doors, trapdoors, pressure plates, buttons. Beacon base, wither-proof, dragon-proof. **Dragon Glass** block and pane for when you want the same tier in a glass aesthetic. All of it survives lava as items and looks the part.

**Dragon Iron Furnace.** Smelts twice as fast as a normal furnace and doesn't use fuel—it's the End's fire. It's also the job site for the **Dragon Smith** villager, so your villages can have a profession that actually ties into the mod.

**Lore.** Six written books (Volumes 1–5 + Epilogue), authored by "The First Dragon Smith." They spawn in End City, dungeons, mineshafts, and village chests—find them or use `/dragoniron givebook` if you're in creative. The story is in the game; the full canon and worldbuilding live in the repo: [**lore**](lore/README.md).

**Config.** One setting: Enderman nugget drop chance (0–100%). There's a custom in-game config screen so you don't have to hunt a file, and when you do open the file it's **readable TOML**—no binary, no gibberish. I care about that stuff.
